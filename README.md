# **Traffic Sign Classification**

## **Overview**
---

This is my completed assignment for the Traffic Sign Classification project of Udacity's Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program.  The goal is to use a neural network to classify German traffic sign images.  I pre-processed the data, created a model, improved it through backpropogation, tested it on new images, and evaluated my progress each step of the way.  The `Writeup.md` document in this repository offers additional explanation.  

## **Setup**
---

This code is written in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.  In order to run it, you will need a python environment with the necessary libraries.  You can follow Udacity's setup instructions for that here: [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md)
The image data set can be downloaded [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic-signs-data.zip)


## **Use**
The code along with visualizations and other details are contained in the Jupyter Notebook titled `GJ_Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb`.
